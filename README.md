# Spectral Analysis

This is a project for analyzing spectral data by Nikki Arendse, Zoe Ansari and Cecilie Hede and Andrew Chepreghy

The project is focused on downloading spectral from the [SDSS survey](https://www.sdss.org/) and using different machine learning algorithms to do automatic classification of stellar objects.

The project is run under the [DARK Cosmology Centre](https://dark.nbi.ku.dk/), [Univesity of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/).
