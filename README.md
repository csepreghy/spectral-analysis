# Spectral Analysis

This is a project for analyzing spectral data by Nikki Arendse, Zoe Ansari and Cecilie Hede and Andrew Chepreghy

The project is focused on downloading spectral from the [SDSS survey](https://www.sdss.org/) and using different machine learning algorithms to do automatic classification of stellar objects.

The aim to create automatic spectrum classification for stellar objects with machine learning that would would save time for researchers not having to classify these objects by eye.

The project is run under the [DARK Cosmology Centre](https://dark.nbi.ku.dk/), [Univesity of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/).
